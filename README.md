# College Admission Chatbot

## Overview
This project implements a chatbot designed to assist users with inquiries related to the college admission process. The chatbot uses machine learning techniques to understand and respond to user queries based on a predefined dataset of questions and answers.

## Features
- **Interactive Interface**: Allows users to input questions about admission requirements, deadlines, majors offered, etc.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to match user queries with the most relevant answers from the dataset.
- **Simple Deployment**: Can be deployed locally for testing or integrated into a web application for broader accessibility.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Libraries:
  - scikit-learn
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - nltk

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/college-admission-chatbot.git
   cd college-admission-chatbot
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Training the Model**:
   - Prepare your dataset (`data.csv` or any suitable format) containing pairs of questions and corresponding answers related to college admissions.
   - Ensure the dataset is structured and cleaned for best results.

2. **Run the Chatbot**:
   - Execute the `chatbot.py` script:
     ```bash
     python chatbot.py
     ```
   - The chatbot will start, prompting you to enter questions about the admission process.
   - Type your query and press Enter to receive an appropriate response.

3. **Interacting with the Chatbot**:
   - Enter questions such as "What are the admission requirements?", "How do I apply for admission?", etc.
   - The chatbot will use its trained model to find the closest match in the dataset and display the corresponding answer.

4. **Exiting the Chatbot**:
   - To exit the chatbot, type "exit" or press Ctrl+C in the terminal.

## Example
Here's a sample interaction with the chatbot:

```
User: What are the admission requirements?
Chatbot: The admission requirements include...

User: How can I apply for admission?
Chatbot: You can apply for admission through our online portal...

User: What majors does the college offer?
Chatbot: The college offers majors in...

User: exit
Chatbot: Goodbye!
```

## Notes
- The effectiveness of the chatbot depends on the quality and relevance of the dataset provided for training.
- Advanced users may extend the functionality by integrating with APIs for real-time updates or deploying the chatbot on a server for broader accessibility.
